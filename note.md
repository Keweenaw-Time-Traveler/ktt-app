# Note
Robert Pastel, 11/9/2022

This file is to track changes that I made to add documentation to the repository,
and to add notes and comments.

**Note:** The doc endpoints.md in this directory (top level project directory,
  ktt-app) is old. I should delete it later.

  1. Made docs directory with sub-directory for each markdown file.
  2. Moved original README.md to docs/original-installation
  3. Made new toplevel README.md
  4.
